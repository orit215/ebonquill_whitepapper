# Dungeons

### The Living World of Dungeons

Dungeons in the game are more than just battlefields—they are living, evolving entities governed by player ownership, strategic management, and a dynamic in-game economy. Each dungeon is a unique, tradeable NFT, procedurally generated at the moment of minting, ensuring that no two dungeons are alike. These dungeons serve as the foundation for both PvE and PvP experiences, offering opportunities for adventure, competition, and wealth generation.

Only **Legendary** heroes can attain the coveted title of **Landlord**, granting them ownership of a dungeon. **Epic** heroes may reach Landlord status only by ascending to the **Legendary** tier. Non-landowners can still explore, raid, and participate in these dungeons, engaging in various activities under the governance of the Landlord.

### Procedural Generation & Unique Features

Each dungeon NFT is generated with a **randomized seed**, stored in its metadata. This seed determines the dungeon’s architecture, terrain, enemy placements, traps, gathering nodes, and quest structures, leveraging **Unreal Engine’s PCG (Procedural Content Generation) system**. Furthermore, each dungeon aligns with the thematic direction of the current **season**, ensuring visual and mechanical diversity with every content update.

Beyond its layout, a dungeon’s procedural content includes:

* **Adaptive questlines**: AI-driven generative technology creates dynamic objectives.
* **Unlockable areas**: Forges for item crafting, temples for hero upgrades, hidden relics, and secret chambers.
* **Resource zones**: Fishing spots, mining nodes, herbal gardens, and hunting grounds.
* **NPC infrastructure**: Vendors, profession trainers, and summonable companions.
* **Customizable defenses**: Mobs, traps, and boss difficulty scaling tailored by the Landlord.

### The Role of Light: The Dungeon’s Core Resource

A dungeon's **Light** is its most valuable resource, functioning as both an energy system and an anti-abuse mechanism for the economy. Light is a **finite** yet **regenerating** resource that dictates the dungeon’s activity levels. Its depletion renders the dungeon unusable—monsters stop spawning, players can no longer revive inside, and resource nodes become barren.

The **rate of Light regeneration** depends on the dungeon’s tier and a balancing mechanism managed by the game’s economy servers. Factors influencing Light include:

* The **tier of the dungeon** (Rare, Epic, or Legendary)
* **Player activity levels** (usage taxation ensures sustainability)
* **Tokenomics-driven balancing** (adaptive algorithms adjust Light replenishment to prevent economy exploitation)

### PvE Adventures: Beyond Combat

For those seeking an immersive RPG experience, dungeons offer far more than just combat. Landlords can configure dungeons to focus on exploration, crafting, and profession-based progression. Players can engage in:

* **Questing**: Procedurally generated narratives unfold as heroes explore the dungeon.
* **Gathering Professions**: Mining ores, fishing, harvesting herbs for alchemy.
* **Survival & Crafting**: Upgrading weapons and armor using rare dungeon materials.
* **Hidden Mysteries**: Uncovering ancient relics and forgotten artifacts.

### PvP Competitive Challenges

Landlords can transform their dungeons into high-stakes battlegrounds, introducing PvP-focused experiences:

* **Sieges**: Players attempt to conquer a dungeon, with potential NFT ownership stakes.
* **Ranked Arenas**: Competitive matches with leaderboard rankings.
* **Tournaments**: High-reward competitions for elite players.
* **Battle Royale Mode**: A shrinking battlefield within the dungeon, forcing players into deadly encounters until only one remains.

### Landlord Economy & Taxation

Owning a dungeon NFT is not just a privilege—it is an economic venture. Landlords generate revenue through a taxation system, collecting a percentage of the **Ebon Coin** (the in-game, non-crypto currency) earned by visiting players, ensuring a steady stream of passive income.

* **Surplus earnings** (beyond the cap) are **redirected to the Landlord**.
* **Top-tier dungeons** have **dynamic taxation**, increasing yield potential.

### Creative Mode: The Landlord’s Domain

Landlords are not just game participants—they are world-builders. Every dungeon has a **central hub** (akin to an estate or keep) where owners manage their domain, economy, and configurations. In **Creative Mode**, dungeons can be transformed into:

* **NFT galleries**, showcasing achievements and rare collectibles.
* **Social hubs**, where players gather outside of combat.
* **Mini-game spaces**, where landlords create custom activities.

Well-maintained dungeons will attract more players, increasing rewards for landlords. With procedural generation, AI-driven questing, and an evolving seasonal structure, dungeons will continuously adapt, offering **endless replayability and a stable, self-regulating economy**.
