# Combat

The combat system in Dungeons is designed to deliver a dynamic, skill-based experience that balances strategy, reflexes, and adaptability. Unlike traditional RPGs with rigid mechanics, combat in Dungeons requires active engagement, precise execution, and mastery of various mechanics to excel in both PvE and PvP scenarios.

**Skill System and Customization**

Players have access to a **skill book** containing 18 active and passive skills, forming the foundation of their combat abilities. As characters progress, they earn **skill points per level**, which can be invested into this skill tree. Every **25 levels**, players unlock a new **skill book stage**, up to a total of **10 stages**, each introducing a set of new skills.

Skills are not static but can be **upgraded from Common to Rare, Epic, and Legendary tiers**, unlocking advanced customization options. These enhancements alter not only the functionality of skills but also their **visual appearance**, making every skill a unique asset. Players can refine their skills at **Shrines**, special dungeon locations accessible to both landowners and visiting players. Using unique **books**, players can modify skill behaviors, adjusting factors like **target detection, erratic movement, power, speed, and range**.

At the highest level of progression, **Legendary skills can be minted as NFTs**, allowing players to trade them in the in-game marketplace, further integrating player-driven customization into the game economy.

**Attributes and Stat Progression**

Character progression is driven by **four primary attributes**:

* **Strength (STR)**
* **Intelligence (INT)**
* **Dexterity (DEX)**
* **Constitution (CON)**

Each level grants **stat points** that players can distribute among these attributes, influencing **17 different stats** that shape a character’s combat efficiency. This level of control ensures that every build is unique, giving players the freedom to specialize in different playstyles.

**Equipment, Companions, and Combat Strategy**

Players can equip **10 items** in their skill bar, a mix of **skills, companions, and consumable items** to adapt to different combat situations.

Companions play a crucial role in battle, with players being able to **carry up to three pets** and **quickly summon them mid-fight**, though only **one can be active at a time**. These pets provide tactical advantages, complementing a player’s combat strategy.

**Tactical Depth and Resource Management**

Combat in Dungeons is designed to be highly engaging, requiring players to make use of **the environment, evasion, and blocking mechanics**. This ensures battles remain **fast-paced and skill-dependent**, avoiding the monotonous nature of traditional auto-combat RPGs.

Three core resources govern combat efficiency:

* **HP (Health Points):** Determines survivability.
* **MP (Mana Points):** Required for skill usage.
* **Stamina:** Essential for running and evading attacks.

Proper resource management is critical to maintaining an edge in battle, as reckless consumption can leave a player vulnerable.

**Class Roles in Cooperative Combat**

Team synergy is vital in both **PvP and PvE**, with class roles playing a decisive role in the success of a party:

* **Tank:** Absorbs damage and controls enemy aggression.
* **DPS (Damage Dealer):** Specializes in high burst damage.
* **Healer:** Supports the team with sustain and recovery.

The emphasis on role specialization ensures cooperative combat is strategic and rewarding, encouraging well-coordinated team play in high-stakes encounters.

Dungeons delivers an immersive, tactical combat experience that merges skillful execution with deep customization. By blending real-time decision-making with economic incentives, the combat system offers players a compelling and rewarding battlefield where both skill and strategy determine the ultimate victor.
