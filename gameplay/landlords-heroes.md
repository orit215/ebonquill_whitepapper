# Landlords and Heroes

### The Heroic Journey: Play-and-Earn and NFT Progression

#### The beginning

When players first step into the world of Ebonquill, they are granted a **Common Hero**, a **free NFT** that serves as their entry point into the adventure. These heroes allow players to experience the core mechanics of the game, engage in combat, complete quests, and earn Ebon Coin, the in-game currency. However, Common Heroes come with limitations—most notably, they cannot own land and have a capped amount of Ebon Coin they can earn per session. To break past these restrictions and fully participate in the game's **Play-and-Earn** ecosystem, players must acquire **Rare**, **Epic**, or **Legendary** Heroes, each offering increased earning potential and additional benefits.

#### The Ascension: NFT Heroes and Their Tiers

Beyond the **Common Hero**, which is granted for free upon registration, players seeking greater rewards and deeper progression can obtain **Rare**, **Epic**, and **Legendary** Heroes, all of which are unique **NFTs**. These premium heroes provide higher earning potential, unique abilities, and long-term advantages within the game's ecosystem. Unlike Common Heroes, they have higher **Ebon Coin** earning caps per session, making them essential for those who wish to maximize their play-and-earn experience.

Players will have the opportunity to acquire these NFT Heroes during the **first and second rounds of the presale (ICO)**, giving **early adopters** access to exclusive characters before they hit the open market. Eventually, these heroes will be available in the **game’s marketplace**, where players can **trade, buy, and sell their assets** freely. Additionally, while **Legendary Heroes are the only ones who can own land**, **Epic Heroes** can undergo a specialized ascension process—a transformative **upgrade** that elevates them to the **Legendary tier**, granting them Landlord status.

### Landlords: The Apex of Power and Wealth

In Ebonquill, the title of Landlord is the ultimate distinction a hero can achieve, symbolizing their command over land and resources. Only Legendary Heroes can naturally own and manage land in the game. These exceptional characters, rare and powerful, are the foundation of the in-game economy, enabling their owners to gain rewards from dungeons, host player-driven events, and collect a portion of the Ebon Coin earned by those adventuring in their domains. The wealth and influence of these Landlords grow as their properties expand, making them integral to the game’s ecosystem and a central force in shaping its economy.

**Epic Heroes**, while not Landlords by default, have the potential to ascend to this elite status. Through a specialized process, Epic Heroes can be transformed into **Legendary Heroes**, unlocking the ability to own land and reap its rewards. This transformation is not a simple upgrade but a key aspect of player progression, making the journey from Epic to Legendary a critical path for those aiming to **maximize their earnings** and influence in the game.

As the game continues to evolve, **Landlords** will be the most powerful players in Ebonquill , driving the game's dynamic economy through the resources they control. The rise of Landlords will redefine the competitive landscape, with Epic Heroes striving to ascend and Common Heroes working toward unlocking the potential of higher tiers. For those looking to build **significant wealth and influence, becoming a Landlord is the ultimate goal.**

### Seasonal Expansions: A Growing World of Heroes

As Ebonquill evolves, new content is introduced through **Seasonal Expansions**, periodic updates that bring fresh heroes, challenges, and rewards. Each season introduces a set of **four new heroes**, spanning all tiers from **Common to Legendary**, ensuring a steady influx of new characters for players to collect and master. These heroes expand the roster, offering new play-styles and strategies that keep the game engaging for both new and veteran players.

**Seasonal Expansions** also introduce subtle shifts in the game’s balance, ensuring that no single strategy dominates indefinitely. By refreshing the available heroes and their abilities, each season creates a dynamic meta, pushing players to experiment with different team compositions and tactics. While earlier-season heroes remain relevant, newer additions provide exciting alternatives, allowing for continuous adaptation and growth.

{% hint style="info" %}
The first season, Twilight’s Last Bastion, will be available as a preview in the game demo, offering players a glimpse into the captivating world of the dungeon. Along with the dungeon experience, each season will introduce four new heroes and assets, expanding the roster for players to collect and utilize. Following the official release of the game, five additional seasons will be launched, each bringing fresh challenges, environments, and dynamic gameplay. The upcoming seasons include Veil of Shadows, Crimson Reign, Echoes of the Forgotten, The Shattered Empire, and Abyssal Dominion. These seasons will feature new thematic dungeons, monsters and quests, as well as new heroes, continuously enriching the gameplay experience.

#### Limited-Time Availability and Future Access

Heroes introduced in a given season are initially available through exclusive means, such as seasonal events, limited-time sales, or special in-game achievements. Players who participate during that season gain early access to these new characters, making them valuable additions to their collection. However, once a season concludes, its heroes do not disappear forever—they will later become available in the in-game marketplace, ensuring that latecomers still have opportunities to acquire them through trading or purchases.

This approach maintains a sense of exclusivity for early adopters while keeping the ecosystem fair and accessible. Players who missed out on a season’s launch still have pathways to obtain its heroes, either through direct marketplace transactions or through future in-game events designed to reintroduce past content.

#### Evolving Playstyles and Strategic Depth

Each season not only expands the roster but also brings subtle shifts in gameplay focus. Some seasons may introduce heroes specialized in defensive tactics, while others may favor high-damage classes or unique support abilities. These shifts encourage players to experiment with different strategies, **ensuring that the game remains fresh** and that no single playstyle dominates the competitive landscape.

While the core mechanics remain unchanged, the introduction of **new heroes** with **distinct abilities** means that players must continuously refine their tactics. This ongoing evolution keeps the game exciting, **rewarding** both adaptability and **long-term investment** in character progression.

### Classes, Skills, and Progression

In Ebonquill, heroes are defined by their classes, which determine their roles, abilities, and progression paths. Each hero begins their journey at Stage 1, equipped with a set of four active skills unique to their class. As heroes gain experience and level up, they unlock new stages, each introducing additional skills and passive abilities, allowing for deeper customization and strategic depth.

#### Class Definition and Roles

At the outset, each hero is assigned a specific class, such as **Shadowknight**, **Sorcerer**, or **Dreadnought**, which dictates their combat style and available abilities. These **classes** provide a framework for the hero's development, influencing their strengths, weaknesses, and preferred tactics in battle. This system ensures that players can choose heroes that align with their preferred play-style, whether it be **frontline combat**, **magical support**, or **stealthy maneuvers**.

#### Skill Evolution and Stages

Heroes commence with **four active skills** pertinent to their class. Every 25 levels, they ascend to a **new Stage**, unlocking four new active skills and additional passive abilities. This progression continues up to **Stage 10**, at which point heroes realize their full potential. This structured evolution encourages players to continually engage with the game, striving to unlock new abilities and enhance their heroes' capabilities.

#### Leveling System: Attributes and Customization

The game's leveling system offers players the opportunity to tailor their heroes' development. With each level gained, heroes receive **Attribute Points** and **Skill Points**. Attribute Points can be allocated to enhance **core stats** such as **strength**, **agility**, or **intelligence**, directly impacting performance in various scenarios. **Skill Points** allow players to **unlock or upgrade abilities**, providing a personalized approach to hero progression. This system empowers players to craft unique builds, fostering a diverse and dynamic gameplay experience.

By integrating defined classes, a robust skill evolution framework, and a flexible leveling system, Ebonquill ensures that each hero's journey is unique, offering depth and replayability for all players.
