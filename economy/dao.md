# DAO

### Governance Through <mark style="color:purple;">**$EPIC**</mark>

Our game’s ecosystem is governed by a **Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)**, empowering <mark style="color:purple;">**$EPIC**</mark> holders with decision-making authority over key aspects of the game’s future. By integrating blockchain-based governance, we ensure a **player-driven economy**, where stakeholders actively shape game development, balance adjustments, and economic policies.

### Governance Model

The DAO operates on a **token-weighted voting system**, meaning that the more <mark style="color:purple;">**$EPIC**</mark> tokens a player holds, the greater their influence on governance decisions. This system ensures that dedicated players and investors have a direct say in the evolution of the ecosystem.

#### Decision-Making Scope

Holders of <mark style="color:purple;">**$EPIC**</mark> will be able to propose and vote on:

* **Game Balance Adjustments** – Changes in hero abilities, dungeon mechanics, and economy tweaks.
* **Marketplace Fees & Taxation** – Adjusting transaction fees, dungeon taxation, and staking incentives.
* **Event & Tournament Structuring** – Voting on new competitive formats, prize pools, and special events.
* **Development Roadmap** – Deciding on new features, expansions, and ecosystem integrations.
* **Treasury Management** – Allocating DAO-controlled funds to development, marketing, and ecosystem sustainability.

### DAO Treasury & Sustainability

The DAO will manage a **community treasury**, funded through:

* **2.5% of marketplace fees in $EPIC** (all trades on the NFT marketplace)
* **Dungeon taxation system contributions** (by tier, as defined in gameplay docs)
* **Portions of staking emissions and liquidity operations**
* **In-game transaction fees** where applicable

These funds will be used to further develop the game, improve infrastructure, and support marketing and community initiatives based on DAO governance decisions.

### Staking & Voting Power

To participate in governance, <mark style="color:purple;">$EPIC</mark> **holders must stake their tokens**, ensuring that only committed participants influence decisions. Staked tokens grant **voting power**, with higher stakes providing greater influence while preventing governance manipulation from short-term speculators.

### DAO Evolution & Community Involvement

As the game and its economy grow, **the DAO structure may evolve**, allowing more **decentralization** and community-driven governance mechanisms. Proposals to refine or expand the DAO’s role will be introduced progressively, keeping governance dynamic and adaptive to the game’s ecosystem.
