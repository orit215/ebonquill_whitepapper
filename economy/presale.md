### NFT Presale

The NFT presale will feature **Dungeon NFTs** and **Hero NFTs**, structured through randomized bundles with varying probabilities. **Direct NFT sales will not be available**, ensuring fairness and preventing immediate monopolization by high-budget players.

#### **Dungeon Key Bundles** (NFT Sale Round 1)

Dungeon NFTs represent **Rare, Epic, and Legendary Dungeons**, each featuring a **seed-based procedural generation system** in Unreal Engine.

* **All dungeons will be sold as "Dungeon Keys," which unlock unique generated dungeons.**
* **Dungeon Keys will be available in randomized bundles:**

<table><thead><tr><th width="220.5">Bundle</th><th width="100.5">Price</th><th width="123">Rare Chance</th><th width="111.5">Epic Chance</th><th width="162">Legendary Chance</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Explorer’s Chest</td><td><strong>1 BNB</strong></td><td><strong>80%</strong></td><td><strong>15%</strong></td><td><strong>5%</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Adventurer’s Vault</td><td><strong>1.5 BNB</strong></td><td><strong>60%</strong></td><td><strong>30%</strong></td><td><strong>10%</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Master’s Reliquary</td><td><strong>2.5 BNB</strong></td><td><strong>40%</strong></td><td><strong>40%</strong></td><td><strong>20%</strong></td></tr></tbody></table>

* **Availability:** Season 1 hard caps across all bundles: **Rare ≤ 4,000**, **Epic ≤ 1,600**, **Legendary ≤ 400** (total ≤ 6,000 keys). If a rarity cap is reached, mints for that rarity stop.
* **Randomness:** On-chain **VRF** used to determine outcomes; probabilities as listed per bundle.
* **Per-Wallet Caps:** Up to **20 Explorer’s Chest**, **10 Adventurer’s Vault**, **5 Master’s Reliquary** per wallet.
* **Round 2:** Prices will increase, making bundles more expensive.

#### **Hero Summon Bundles** (NFT Sale Round 1)

Hero NFTs will be sold in **summon packs**, granting a **chance to receive a Rare, Epic, or Legendary hero**.

* **Hero NFTs will be distributed via summon packs with weighted probabilities:**

<table data-full-width="false"><thead><tr><th width="219.5">Pack Name</th><th width="107.5">Price</th><th width="124">Rare Chance</th><th width="114">Epic Chance</th><th width="151.5">Legendary Chance</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Apprentice’s Call</td><td><strong>0.1 BNB</strong></td><td><strong>85%</strong></td><td><strong>12%</strong></td><td><strong>3%</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Warrior’s Pact</td><td><strong>0.5 BNB</strong></td><td><strong>60%</strong></td><td><strong>30%</strong></td><td><strong>10%</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Champion’s Oath</td><td><strong>1 BNB</strong></td><td><strong>40%</strong></td><td><strong>40%</strong></td><td><strong>20%</strong></td></tr></tbody></table>

* **Availability:** Season 1 hero mint caps across packs: **Rare ≤ 35,000**, **Epic ≤ 12,000**, **Legendary ≤ 3,000** (total ≤ 50,000 heroes). Pity system: **+1% Legendary chance every 10 packs opened without a Legendary** (resets on Legendary).
* **Randomness:** On-chain **VRF** used to determine outcomes; probabilities as listed per pack.
* **Per-Wallet Caps:** Up to **500 Apprentice’s Call**, **200 Warrior’s Pact**, **100 Champion’s Oath** per wallet.
* **Round 2:** Higher prices for all summon packs.

The **Dungeon NFTs** are fully integrated with **Unreal Engine's PCG system**, allowing unique procedural dungeon creation. Players will be able to explore these dungeons, each possessing its own rarity and difficulty, adding value to ownership.

Similarly, **Hero NFTs** will function as playable characters, with their attributes directly influencing in-game performance. The ability to summon **Rare, Epic, or Legendary Heroes** through packs encourages strategic planning and investment.
