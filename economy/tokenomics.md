# Tokenomics

### **Token Utility**

Our Play & Earn dungeon crawler RPG is powered by <mark style="color:purple;">**$EPIC**</mark>, a Binance Smart Chain (BSC) token that facilitates all major economic interactions, including marketplace transactions, staking, and real-world value extraction. The game also features **Ebon Coin**, a non-crypto in-game currency used for daily economic activities.

| Blockchain   | Binance Smart Chain (BSC) |
| ------------ | ------------------------- |
| Symbol       | $EPIC                     |
| Total Supply | 50.000.000                |
|              |                           |

* <mark style="color:purple;">**$EPIC**</mark>**&#x20;Utility:**
  * Marketplace purchases (NFTs like heroes, consumables, dungeon keys, etc)
  * Staking for passive rewards and governance participation
  * **Exchangeable** for real-world value on decentralized exchanges (DEXs)
  * Used to restore "Light," the dungeon resource controlling accessibility
  * Governance **voting** in the DAO for economic adjustments and game development decisions
* **Ebon Coin Utility:**
  * Earned through PvE and PvP activities
  * Used for in-game transactions (crafting, repairs, NPC trades, upgrades)
  * Can be converted to <mark style="color:purple;">**$EPIC**</mark> under regulated conditions
  * **Account-bound and non-transferable between players; conversion only via the Oracle (no P2P trading)**

### **Dual-Currency System**

The game operates on a **dual-currency economy** to maintain stability and accessibility:

* **Ebon Coin (Non-Crypto):** Earned through gameplay, subject to daily limits based on hero rarity. Prevents exploitation and ensures controlled distribution.
* <mark style="color:purple;">**$EPIC**</mark>**&#x20;(BSC Token):** Used for blockchain-based transactions, trading, and staking. Its generation is limited to certain controlled methods to prevent inflation.

Conversion from Ebon Coin to <mark style="color:purple;">**$EPIC**</mark> is regulated via an **AI-driven oracle system** to adjust exchange rates dynamically based on economic activity.

### **Token Generation and Distribution**

Unlike traditional inflationary P2E models, our system **controls&#x20;**<mark style="color:purple;">**$EPIC**</mark>**&#x20;generation** through:

* **Ebon Coin conversion limits** to prevent uncontrolled emissions.
* **Marketplace trading**, where NFT sales generate demand.
* **Staking rewards** as an alternative income source for holders.
* **Periodic airdrops and special event rewards.**
* **Dungeon Landlord taxation**, where Landlords earn a portion of dungeon-generated Ebon Coin.

### **Token Allocation**

The total supply of <mark style="color:purple;">**$EPIC**</mark> is allocated as follows:

| Allocation Category        | Percentage |
| -------------------------- | ---------- |
| **Play & Earn Rewards**    | 50%        |
| **Staking & Liquidity**    | 18%        |
| **Development Fund**       | 12%        |
| **Marketing & Airdrops**   | 8%         |
| **Ecosystem Growth**       | 2%         |
| **Public & Private Sale**  | 10%        |

### **Marketplace & NFT Integration**

The in-game **NFT marketplace** allows players to trade key assets, including:

* **Heroes (NFTs):** Playable characters with customizable skills.
* **Dungeon Keys (NFTs):** Grants ownership of dungeons, allowing passive income from taxes.
* **Rare Items (NFTs):** Unique gear, skins, and collectibles.
* **Legendary Skills (NFTs):** Unique, fully customizable, tradeable abilities that grant powerful effects, exclusive to Legendary-tier heroes.

A **2.5% transaction fee in **<mark style="color:purple;">**$EPIC**</mark> applies to all marketplace sales and is routed to the **DAO Treasury** to fund operations and ecosystem growth.

### **Anti-Inflation & Sustainability Measures**

To prevent economic collapse due to hyperinflation, the following mechanisms are in place:

* **Ebon Coin daily earning caps** based on hero rarity.
* **Oracle-driven exchange rate** to prevent token devaluation.
* **Landlord taxation system**, ensuring steady token redistribution (by dungeon tier: **Rare 5% fixed; Epic 10%–20% (default 15%); Legendary 15%–35% (default 20%)**).
* **Staking incentives** to encourage token retention rather than liquidation.
* **Light system** that limits dungeon farming, preventing excessive rewards.

#### Conversion Controls (enforced by the Oracle)

* **Per-hero weekly conversion limits** (examples): Common 500, Rare 1,000, Epic 1,800, Legendary 3,000 Ebon Coin per week (variable with rate; see Oracle for full table).
* **Per-hero conversion cooldowns**: 24h for Common/Rare, 36h for Epic/Legendary after each conversion.
* **Landlord weekly conversion caps (per dungeon)**: Rare 5,000; Epic 10,000; Legendary 20,000 Ebon Coin, adaptively scaled by liquidity health.
* **Dynamic rate bands**: Normal 700:1–1000:1; Emergency up to 1200:1 under stress.

### **Play & Earn Economy**

Players earn Ebon Coin by engaging in:

* **PvE activities** (questing, hunting mobs, gathering resources, raid bosses).
* **PvP battles** (duels, ranked tournaments, arena competitions).
* **Resource selling** to NPC vendors.
* **In-game commerce**, excluding the NFT marketplace.

Ebon Coin earnings are capped per hero rarity:

* **Common Heroes:** 100 Ebon Coin/day
* **Rare Heroes:** 200 Ebon Coin/day
* **Epic Heroes:** 300 Ebon Coin/day
* **Legendary Heroes:** 500 Ebon Coin/day

Any Ebon Coin exceeding these caps is **redirected to the Landlord** of the dungeon, ensuring economic sustainability and rewarding NFT holders.

### **Liquidity & Real-World Conversion**

Players can convert <mark style="color:purple;">**$EPIC**</mark>**&#x20;to BNB** through decentralized exchanges (DEXs), ensuring real-world value extraction. Additionally, the game supports **liquidity pools** to maintain stability and allow easy swapping.

### **Governance & Long-Term Vision**

While initially centralized, governance will gradually transition to **community-driven proposals** where <mark style="color:purple;">**$EPIC**</mark> holders can vote on:

* Economic adjustments (Ebon Coin caps, exchange rates)
* Marketplace fee structures
* New game content and expansions

This ensures a **long-term, player-incentivized economy** where key stakeholders drive the game's evolution.

### **Vesting & Locks**

* **Public & Private Sale (10%)**: 10% at TGE, 2-month cliff, then linear vesting over 10 months.
* **Development Fund (12%)**: 12-month cliff, then linear vesting over 24 months.
* **Staking & Liquidity (18%)**: Emitted per Oracle-governed schedule; LP tokens locked for 6 months.
