# Game Modes

### Dungeon Management and Creative Mode

One of the central features in Ebonquill is the ability for **Landlords** to **manage and customize** their own realms. Here, you step into the role of a master builder, shaping the very fabric of your dungeon as you see fit. This mode encourages self-expression and the management of not just the **dungeon’s layout** but also its **economy** and **structure**. You can adjust the atmosphere, design intricate **traps**, and **create** an environment where other heroes can test their mettle. Beyond that, it’s a space to **exhibit your achievements and collectables**, with your dungeon serving as a **personal showcase**. But it’s not all about decoration; in this mode, landlords also have access to **detailed analytics**, keeping track of their dungeon's **performance, resources, and player interactions**. It’s a blend of creativity, strategy, and ownership.

### PvE Adventures

For those seeking a more classic **RPG** experience, **PvE** offers a vast realm of challenges beyond mere combat. Heroes can embark on perilous **quests**, unraveling **mysteries**, and uncovering long-lost **artifacts**, or dedicate themselves to **resource gathering** through activities like **mining** rare ores, **fishing** in enchanted waters, and **harvesting** potent herbs for **crafting and alchemy**. Whether braving the depths alone or forming alliances, players will face relentless waves of **monsters**, powerful **bosses**, and hidden **treasures**, all while refining their **skills** and enhancing their **gear**. With the choice to enable or disable **Player Killing (PK)**, danger can come from both the environment and other adventurers. Some **landlords** may even open their domains to the **public**, turning their dungeons into battlegrounds for **shared conquests**. Whether through strategic farming, quest completion, or raw survival, every hero carves their own path to power in this unforgiving world

### PvP Competitive Challenges

The competitive spirit comes alive in the exclusive **PvP modes**, where strategy, skill, and quick reflexes determine the victors. Here, **landlords can expose their dungeons to the public**, turning them into high-stakes **battlegrounds** for all to challenge. Sieges allow other players to attempt to breach your fortress in exchange for **massive rewards**, including the possibility of **claiming your dungeon and its NFT ownership**. **Ranked arenas** provide a place for players to test their mettle against others in structured, competitive matches, while **exclusive tournaments** bring even higher stakes with rewards fit for the most elite. For those who thrive under pressure, the **Battle Royale mode** offers an intense survival experience, where players must navigate a dungeon gradually overtaken by an encroaching shroud of shadows. Each step through its twisting corridors becomes increasingly treacherous as magic infuses the darkness, transforming familiar halls into perilous traps. Bound by an ancient curse, these converging shadows draw combatants ever closer to the heart of chaos, squeezing the battlefield until only the strongest remain standing.&#x20;

These modes are **governed by the Landlords themselves**, who not only control the environment but also set the rules of engagement, making each encounter a unique and dynamic experience.
